===========================================================
There are 3 structures provided. Yes, these could also be classes with public data, 
but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data and not 
operations as we would with classes.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain
information about Tours to South America.
The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries along with population and cost data for 
each city tour.
